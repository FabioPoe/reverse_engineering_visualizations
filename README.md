# reverse_engineering_visualizations

In this repository you will find all the code i ended up using to write my bachelors thesis (the file 2022_BachelorThesis_PÃ¶schko.pdf), because some code from failed tries is messy and unneccesary i tried to only upload useful files. 
If you feel like i missed to upload some important files, please create an issue, or contact me. Also if you study at JKU i can give you all my files with a USB stick and maybe explain some additional things about my code.

Since the github has a  limit of 25mb for filesize some files were simply to big to upload, if this was the case for an important file, then i created a "what_should_be_here.txt" in its place, which should explain what should be in the place of this file, but can't be here.

## structure of this repository

The mark classification folder holds the most important code for mark classification.
The text localization holds the most important code for text localization and recognition.
The text role classification folder holds the most important code for text role classification.

The merging folder basically combines the 3 previous folders into one big function.
- In the merging folder there are 2 notebooks, one is well described and has lots of plots, the other one is not well described, but i still wanted it there to make show, that i generated some plots, and that they did not just magically appear in my bachelors thesis
